    "Paragraph": "Seafloor sediments can be categorized into about five groups depending on the place of origin. Terrigenous sediments are as a result of deposition of material weathered and eroded from rocks on land. They are basically found just close to their source and reduced in concentration as you move away. Authogenic sediments are produced as a result of chemical reactions of different substances in water. They are also called hydrogenic sediments. Biogenic sediments are formed from mineral deposits like teeth of shell that are produced by living things. Evaporites, phosphorites and ferromanganesse are the common examples. Volcanogenic are sediments that are formed from deposition of materials from volcanic activities.",

The Instagram app was launched on 6th October, 2010, and racked up 25,000 users in one day. From the beginning, the primary focus of the app was to feature photographs, specifically those taken on mobile devices. Just prior to Instagram's initial public offering (IPO) in 2012, Facebook acquired the company for $1 billion in cash and stock.\"",

The Carthaginians surrendered all of their weapons, but the Romans pressed on to besiege the city of Carthage (siege engine depicted). The Romans suffered repeated setbacks.
